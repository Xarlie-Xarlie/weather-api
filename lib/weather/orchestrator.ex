defmodule Weather.Orchestrator do
  @moduledoc """
  A module responsible for orchestrating weather data requests. It initializes
  the request process, spawns worker processes for each location, and collects
  the results when all workers complete their tasks.

  @doc """
  Starts a weather data request for a list of locations.

  ## Parameters
    - `locations`: A list of maps, where each map contains location details
      (e.g., latitude, longitude, state).

  ## Returns
    - `{:ok, results}`: A tuple containing the results when all requests are completed.
    - `{:error, :timeout}`: A tuple indicating a timeout if the requests do not complete
      within the specified time.

  ## Example
      locations = [
        %{state: "SÃ£o Paulo", latitude: -23.55, longitude: -46.63},
        %{state: "Belo Horizonte", latitude: -19.92, longitude: -43.94}
      ]
